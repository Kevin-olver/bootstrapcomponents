          <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment's <i>PlayStation 5</i> (PS5) is a home gaming console. The <i>PlayStation 5</i> was announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4, and it was released on November 12, 2020. The <i>PlayStation 5</i> is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, which also includes Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, which were released in the same month. The default model comes with an optical disc drive that can play Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, allowing it to serve as a more affordable option for those who prefer to purchase games digitally. The two variants were released at the same time. The <i>PlayStation 5</i> is powered by a custom system on a chip (SoC) designed in collaboration between AMD and Sony, which incorporates a custom 7 nm AMD Zen 2 CPU with eight cores able to all run at a variable frequency capped at 3.5 GHz. The integrated GPU is a custom unit as well, based on AMD's RDNA 2 graphics architecture. The GPU has 36 computer units that run at a variable frequency capped at 2.23 GHz, giving it a theoretical peak performance of 10 teraflops. The GPU supports hardware-accelerated real-time ray tracing, which enables realistic lighting and reflections. The console includes Bluetooth 5.1 and 802.11ax, as well as 16 GB of GDDR6 SDRAM with a peak bandwidth of 448 GB/s which is called Wi-Fi 6. The <i>PlayStation 5's</i> internal storage is a custom-built 825 GB solid-state drive (667 GB available) with a 12-channel interface and a raw throughput of 5.5 GB/s. This unusual drive size was discovered to be better suited for the 12-channel pathway than a more common 512 GB or 1 TB unit. </p>
