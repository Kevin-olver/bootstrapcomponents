            <p>Sony Computer Entertainment is the company that created and the <i>PlayStation</i>, a home video game console. It was released on December 3, 1994 in Japan, September 9, 1995 in North America, September 29, 1995 in Europe, and November 15, 1995 in Australia. Sony's ascent to dominance in the video gaming business was signaled by the <i>PlayStation</i>. It was well-received and had excellent sales; in less than ten years, it had shipped more than 100 million units. The main microprocessor is a 32-bit LSI R3000 CPU running at 33.86 MHz and 30 MIPS. Another GPU chip's job is to draw 2D polygons and apply shading and textures. Sony's custom 16-bit sound chip supports ADPCM sources with up to 24 audio channels, offering sampling rates up to 44.1 kHz and MIDI sequences. There is 2MB of main RAM and an additional 1MB of him is allocated for video memory. <i>PlayStation</i> features a color depth of up to 16.7 million True Colors with 32 levels of transparency and unlimited color lookup tables. <i>PlayStation</i> uses its own video compression unit MDEC. It's built into the CPU and can display full-motion video in better quality than other consoles of the same generation. Unusually for the time, the <i>PlayStation</i> doesn't have a dedicated 2D graphics processor for him. Instead, 2D elements are rendered as polygons by the Geometry Transfer Engine (GTE) so they are processed by the GPU and displayed on screen. the GPU can also generate 360,000 flat shading per second, plus a total of 4,000 sprites and 180,000 polygons per second. There have been 3,061 <i>PlayStation</i> games released globally; Gran Turismo (1997), which sold 10.85 million copies, is the system's top seller. The total number of software units shipped after the <i>PlayStation</i> was discontinued in 2006 was 962 million.</p>
