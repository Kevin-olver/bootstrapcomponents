          <p>Sony Computer Entertainment's <i>PlayStation 3</i> (PS3) is a home video game console. The <i>PlayStation 3</i> is the successor to the PlayStation 2 that was released in 2000. It was first released in Japan on November 11, 2006, North America on November 17, 2006, and Europe and Australia on March 23, 2007. As part of the seventh generation of video game consoles, the <i>PlayStation 3</i> competed primarily against Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii. The console was first announced at E3 2005, and it was released at the end of 2006. It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disks as its primary form of storage. The PlayStation was the first to integrate social gaming services, such called the PlayStation Network, and the first to be controllable from a handheld console, thanks to its remote connectivity with the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. The Slim model of the <i>PlayStation 3</i> was later released in September of 2009. It no longer supported the hardware required to run PS2 games. It was lighter and thinner than the original version, with a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor software startup change. Following that, a Super Slim variant was released. In late 2012, a Super Slim variant was released, further refining and redesigning the console. The <i>PlayStation 3's</i> hardware has also been used to build high-performance supercomputers. Dr. Frank Mueller, Associate Professor of Computer Science at NCSU, clustered 8 <i>PlayStation 3's</i> on January 3, 2007. Mueller stated that the 256 MB of system RAM is a limitation for this application and that he is considering retrofitting more RAM. Fedora Core 5 Linux ppc64, MPICH2, OpenMP v 2.5, GNU Compiler Collection, and CellSDK 1.1 are among the software included. The US military has purchased clusters of <i>PlayStation 3</i> units for research purposes as a more cost-effective alternative to traditional supercomputers. </p>
