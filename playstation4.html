          <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment's <i>PlayStation 4</i> (PS4) is a home video game console. It was announced in February 2013 as the successor to the PlayStation 3 and was released on November 15, 2013It is an eighth-generation console that competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch. Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console includes an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built on the x86-64 architecture, with a possible peak of 1.84 teraflops; AMD claimed it was the "most powerful" APU it had developed to date. The <i>PlayStation 4</i> further emphasizes social interaction and integration with other devices and services, like the ps3, such as the ability to play games off-console on the PlayStation Vita and other supported devices ("Remote Play"), as well as the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely ("Share Play"). The controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, as well as an integrated touchpad. The console also supports 4K resolution multimedia playback aswell as HDR10 High-dynamic-range video. The <i>PlayStation 4</i> is powered by an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) developed in collaboration with Sony. It includes a central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics processing unit (GPU), as well as other components like a memory controller and video decoder. The system's GDDR5 memory supports a maximum clock frequency of 2.75 GHz (5500 MT/s) and a memory bandwidth of 176 GB/s. The console has 8 GB of GDDR5 memory, which is 16 times the amount of RAM found in the PS3, and is expected to provide the console with significant longevity. The <i>PlayStation 4</i> also includes Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, and two USB 3.0 ports all built in the game system.</p>
